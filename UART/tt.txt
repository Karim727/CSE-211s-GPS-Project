Shihab Modification: added Bit_Utilities.h 

Shihab Modification: modified UART.C to enable PORTD for UART6 on pin 5,4 and modified the function GetCommand to add null pointer at the end to terminate

Shihab: updated UART.c now PORTA and PORTD are available and initialized, (UART0 --> PC) and (UART6 <-- GPS)
	UART0 has two functions (outChar, OutString) and same for UART6
